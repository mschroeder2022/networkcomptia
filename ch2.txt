THE HOP
	a packet passes through a router
	next hop	
		destination address of the next gateway
	a router doesn't need to know how to get everywhere
		it just needs to know how to get out of here
		a default route handles everything not specifically listed
	a "time to live" IPv4, "hop limit" in IPv6
		avoids a packet looping forever
	configuring the next hop
		every router needs to know where traffic should be sent
			packets always ask for directions
		a router with the incorrect next hop will result in a routing problem
			data will go in the wrong direction
			
Default routes
	a route when no other route matchess
		"gateway of last resort"
			0.0.0.0/0
	can dramaticall simplify the routing process 
		works in conjunction with all the other routing methods
	Routing metrics
		each protocol has its own way of calculating the best route
		metric values are assigned by the routing protocol
		Use metrics to choss between redundant links
			choose the lowest metric

Administrative distances
	hybrid methods use different protocols that have different calculations
		administrative distances
		used by the router to determine which routing protocol has priority

Managing network utilization
