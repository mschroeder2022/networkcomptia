*CIA TRIAD 4.1*
CONFIDENTIALITY	AVAILABILITY	INTEGRITY
fundamentals of security

confidentiality- prevent disclosure of info to unauthorized individuals or systems
	encryption-encode messages
	access controls- restrict access to a resource
	steganography- conceal information within another piece of information

integrity- messages cant be modified without detection
	data is stored and transferred as intended
	Hashing- map data of arbitrary length to data of a fixed length
	digital signature- mathematical scheme to verify the integrity of data
	certificaties- combine with a digital signature to verify an individual
	non-repudiation- provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine

availability- systems and networks must be up and running
	information is accessible to authorized users
	redundancy- always available services
	fault tolerance- system runs even during a failure
	patching-stability; close security holes

*SECURITY CONCEPTS*

vulnerability- weakness in a system
types:
data injection 
broken authentication process
sensitive data exposure
security misconfig

Zero-day attacks
	many applications have vulnerabilities
	Someone is working hard to find the next big vulnerability
has not been detected or published
	exploits are increasingly common 

CVE=common vulnerabilities and exposure

Threat-vulnerability can be exploited by a threat
	intential or accidental
	a resource can have a vulnerability
		exploitation through a threat agent
			threat agent takes a threat action to exploit the vulnerability
Insider threats

Vulnerability databases
CVE
	community managed list of vulnerability
NVD= US National Vulnerability Database
	summary of CVEs
		more detail than CVE
Exploits
	take advantage of a vulnerability

Least privilege- rights and permissions should be set to the bare minimum
		all user accounts must be limited
			applications should run with minimal privileges

RBAC= role- based access control
	roles in an organization should correlate with adequate amount of privileges
	admins provide access based on the role of the use

Windows
	Groups to provide role-based access control

Zero trust- holistic approach to have security coverage across everything 
	many networks are relatively open on the inside
	Everything must be verified
		multifactor authentication,
		encryption
		system permissions, 
		additional firewalls
		monitoring and analytics
	

*Defense in Depth*
layering the defense
	physical controls
	technical controls
	administrative controls

DMZ or Screened subnet
	layer  of security between internet and server
	public access to public resources

Seperation of duties
	Split knowledge
	dual control
		two people must be present to unlock or open or etc

Network Access Control = NAC
	portbased
	you dont get access until you authenticate
	physical interfaces
EAP=extensible authentication protocol
	perform authentication
RADIUS= remote authentication dial in user service

		google hack honeypot
		wordpot
	constant battle to discern what is real and what is fake


*AUTHENTICAITON METHODS*
Local authentication
	authentication credentials are stored on the lodcal device
	very manual process
		password change on all devices manually
	doesnt rely on a third-party authentication server
		
Multifactor athentication=MFA
	you are 
	you have 
	you know
	you do
can be expensice
	sepearate hardware tokens
	specialized scanning equipment
ca be inexpensive
	free smartphone applications

RADIUS= remote authentication dial-in user service
often uses ethernet
one of the more common AAA protocols
centralize authentication for users
	routers, swtiches, firewalls
	server authentication
	remote VPN access
	802.1X network access
RADIUS services available on almost any server operating system	

TACACS=terminal access controller accesss-control system
	remote authentication protocol

TACACS+ 1993
	more authentication requests and response codes

LDAP= Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
protocol for reading and writing directories over an IP network
	an organized set of record, like a phone directory
X.500 specification was written by ITU=international telecommunications union
DAP ran on the OSI protocol stack
LDAP is lightweight protocol used to query and update an x.500 directory

Kerberos
network authentication protocol
	authenticate once, trusted by the system
	no need to re-authenticate
	mutual authentication- the client and the server
SSO with Kerbos
	authenticate one time 
		lots of backend ticketing
		cryptographic tickets

vpn concentrator use radius servers
cisco devices use TACACS+
Kerberos or LDAP use in a microsoft network

identify assets that could be affected by an attack 
identify threats
determine the risk level

	Switch spoofing
		some switch support automatic configuration

thers no authentication required
	pretend to be a switch
		send trunk negotiation
	now you have a trunk link to a switch 
	
Switch administrators should disable trunk negotiation
	administratively configure trunk interfaces and device/access interfaces

Double tagging
	craft a packet that includes two VLAN tags
		take advantage of the "native" VLAN configuration
	the first native VLAN tag is removed by the first switch
		the second "fake" tag is now visible to the second switch
		packet is forwarded to the target
	this is a one-way trip
		responses dont have a way back to the source host
		good for DoS
	 dont put any devices on the native VLAN
		change the native VLAN ID
		force tagging of the native VLAN

*SPOOFING*
pretend to be something you arent
fake web server, dns servver
on path attack
	sit in the middle of the convo

ARP poisonoing = IP spoofing

IP address spoofing
take someone else's IP address
	can be legitimate
		arp poisoning
		dns amplificaiton
	easier to identify than MAC address spoofing
MAC spoofing
 your Ethernet device has a MAC address
	changing the MAC address can be legitimate
		internet provider expects a certain MAC address
			certain applications require a particular MAC address
	it might not be legitimate
		circumvent MAC-based ACLs
		fake-out a wireless address filter

Port security
prevent unauthorized users from connecting to a switch interface
based on the source MAC address
Each port has its own config

port security operation
1. configure a maxium number of source MAC addresses on an interface
2. the switch monitors the number of unique MAC addresses
3. one you exceed the maxium, port security activates

Dynamic ARP inspection
relies on DHCP snooping for intel
	knows all IP address info and the connecting MAC address
intercept all ARP requests and responses
