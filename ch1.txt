identifying intersting octet
calculate magic number (256- intersting octet)
calculate host range
network address
broadcast address

===========================
Example:
IP address 165.254.77.14
subnet mask 255.255.240.0----------------- 265-240=16 range
--------------------------------------------
subnet ID 165.254.64.0
	64 comes from where 77 can fit within the range


Broadcast ID
	to find interesting octet= subnet ID + magic number - 1
165.245.79.255
	64+16-1=79

Host Range
	subnet ID + 1 = first host 165.245.64.1
	broadcast-1= last host 165.245.79.254

	physical address of a network adapter (network interface card)
		NIC= computer hardware that connects a computer to a computer network

	EUI(48 bit)
	
	8c:2d:aa						:		4b:98:a7
	OUI-Organizationally UniqueIdentifier			Network  Interface  Controller-Specific
		-"manufacturor"						-"serial number"
	
EUI-48 ------>EUI-64
	split the mac in half
		24 bit halves or 3 byte halves
	put "FFFE" in the middle of the 16 bits
	invert the 7th bit of the initial address
		changes the address from globally unique and universal
		turns the burned-in address (BIA ) into a locally administered address
		This is the U/L bit (universal/local)
		"universal to local address"

building the IPv6 address
	64 bit subnet prefix
	the EUI- 64 address
	
	64-bit IPv6 Subnet Prefix					3byte MAC			FFFEE			3 byte MAC
	2600:dddd:1111:0001:					8e2d:aa			ff:fe				4b:98a7

IPV6 ADDRESS
	Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
		provides address blocks to  RIRs(Regional Internet Registries)
			RIRs assigns smaller subnet blocks to  ISPs
				ISP assigns a /48 subnet to the customer

subnetting the IPv6 address
	provided by IANA/RIR/ISP			locally assigned			Host ID
	Global routing Prefix= 48 bits			Subnet=16bits			host=64 bits
	2600:DDD:1111					0001					0000:0000:0000:0001

	privides automatic address/ IP configurations for almost all devices
	STEPS
		1. Discover
		2. Offer
		3. Request- IP looks good and ready to use
		4. Acknowledgement- configures the offered IP
		

	ENTERPRISES WITH DHCP
		uses Ipv4 broadcast
			limited comms that stop at the router
		multiple servers needed to handle the load of devices
	DHCP relay/ helper function= relays the broadcast directly to DHCP server
