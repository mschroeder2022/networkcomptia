*NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING METHODOLOGY 5.1*

Identify the problem
	gather information
	question users
	identify
	symptoms
	determine if anything has changed
	approach multiple problems individually 

Establish a theory
	start with the obvious
	consider everything
	divide and conquer
	
Test the thoery
	confirm the theory
	dont work theory
		re-establish new theory or escalata
		
create a plan of action
implement the solution
verify full system functionality
	implement precent measures
Document finds
	update the knowledge base

Troubleshooting a network
	identify the problem
	establish a theory of probable cause
	Test the theory to determine cause
	establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects
	implement the solution or escalate as necessary
	verify fully system functionality and implement precentative measures
	document findings, actions and outcomes

*CABLE CONNECTIVITY 5.2*
unshielded and shielded
U= unshielded
s= braided shielding
f= foil shielding

(over cable) / (individual pairs) TP


plenum-rated cable
	traditional cable jacket
		PVC
	fire-rated cable jacket
		FEP
		PVC
	plenum-rated cable may not be as flexible
	worst-case planning
		used in plenum and risers
		important concers for an structure
serial consol cables
	D-subminiature or D-sub
		letter refers to the connector size
	commononly used for RS-232
		recommended standard 232
		an industry standard since 1969
	serial communications standard
		built for modem communication
		used for modems, printers, mice, networking
	now used as a configuration port

POE=power over ethernet
	power provided on an ethernet cable
	power provided at the switch
		built in power= endspans
		inline power injector= midspans
	power modes
	A= common- mode data pair power
	B= power on the spare pair
	4-pair- power on all four data pair

POE: IEEE 802.3af-2003
	15.4 watts DC power, 350 mA max current
POE+: IEEE 802.3at-2009
	25.5 watts DC power, 600 mA max current
POE++: IEE 802.3bt-2018
	51 W (type 3) 600mA max current
	71.3 W (type 4,) 960 mA max current
	POE with 10GBASE-T

*WIRED NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING*

Attenuation
	gradual signal strength diminishes over distance
	loss of signal internsity as signal moves through a medium
Decibels (dB)
Signal strength ratio mesurements
3dB= 2x the signal
10dB=10X
20dB=100X
30dB= 1000x the signal

EMI=electromagnetic interference
	cable handling

Bad ports
Interface errors
Verify configurations
	Speed, duplex, VLAN, etc.
Verify two-way traffic
	end-to end connectivity

Interface configuration
	auto vs. manual configuration
	light status
	speeds
	duplex
		if mismatched, speed will suffer
		increase in late collisions
short circuit
	two connections are touching 
	wires inside of a cable or connection
open circuits
	break in the connection
complete interruption
	can be intermittent

Time domain frelector
	tool used to tell where the connection is loss

incorrect tranceivers
	have to match the fiber
	single mode transceiver connects to single mode fiber
tranceiver needs to match the wavelength
	use the correct transceivers and optical fiber
	signal loss
		dropped frames, missing frames

*HARDWARE TOOLS*
Cable crimpers = pinch the connector to the wire
Punch down tools= punch a wire into a wiring block
tone generator and probe= used to find a wire






*SOFTWARE TOOLS 5.3*
Wireless packet analysis

Protocol analyzer= wireshark

Speed test sites
bandwitdth testing

iPerf
-performance monitoring and speed testing
-two computers needed

IP and port scanners
	range of IP addresses  

NetFlow
	father traffic statistics from all traffic flows
	uses probe and collector
		probe watches network communication
		summary reccords are sent to the collector

TFTP server
trivial file transfer protocol
	bare minimum file transfer protocol
your device is the TFTP server
	the switch/firewall/router is the TFTP client

Terminal emulator
SSH
	encrypted terminal communication
	replaces telnet and ftp
	


*COMMAND LINE TOOLS*
ping- test reachability
ipconfig/ifconfig/ip address

nslookup and dig
lookup info from DNS servers
	dig=domain information groper
		adv dns information

traceroute
-determine the route a packet takes to a destination
-tracert or traceroute

ARP=address resolution protocol
determine a MAC address based on an IP address

netstat
network statistics
-a	show all active connections
-n 	just ip addresses
-b	shows binaries

hostname
view the FQDN and IP address of the device

route
view device routing table

Telnet-telecommunication network
tcp/23
login to devices remotely
	in the clear communicaiton
