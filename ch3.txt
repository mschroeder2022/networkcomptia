*PERFORMANCE METRICS 3.1*\
Device Performance
	temperature
		internal sensors,
		can be an early warning of excessive utilization or hardware issues
CPU usage
	measures performance of the processor/s
	overall performance is usually based on these values
Memory
	the operational resource
	running out of memory is usually a fatal event

Bandwidth monitors
	the fundamental network statistic
		amount of network use over time
	Gathering the metric
		SNMP, NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX protocol analysis, software agent
	Identify fundamental issues
		nothing works properly if bandwidth is highly utilized

Latency
a delay between the request and the response
	waiting time
come latency is expected and normal
examine the reponse times at every step along the way
	multiple measurement tools
packet captures can provide detailed analysis
	microsecond granularity
	get captures from both sides

Jitter
most real-time media is sensitive to delay
	data should arrive at regular intervals
	voice comms, live video
	no retransmission
jitter is the time between frames
	excessive jitter can cause you to miss information 
		choppy voice calls

Monitoring the interface
	often your first sign of trouble
	sometimes indicate a bigger issue
	view in the operating system
		interface details
Monitor with SNMP
	remote monitoring of all devices
	most metrics are in MIB-II
	proprietary MIB may be available

Interface monitoring
	link status
		link up or down
	Error rate
		problems with the signal
		CRC error, runt, giant
	Utilization 
		per-interface network usage
		run bandwidth test to view throughput
	discards, packet dropps
		no errors in the packet, but system could not process
	interface resets
		packets are queued, but arent sent
		connection is good, but line protocols arent talking
		reset and hope for the best
	Speed and duplex
		these should match on both sides
		auto speed and auto duplex isnt always the best option
		check for expected throughput and late collisions
		

*SNMP*
Simple Network Management Protocol
	centrailized database
		a database of data (MIB)- management information base
		the database contain OIDs- Object Identifiers
		poll devices udp/161
SNMP v1
	structured tables, in the clear
SNMP v2
	data type enhancements, bulk transfers, 
	in the clear
SNMP v3
	message integrity, authentication, encryption

SNMP OIDs
	object identifier- referenced by name or number

SNMP traps
	most SNMP operations expect a poll
		devices then respond to the SNMP request
		this requires constant polling
	traps can be configured on the monitored device
		communicates over udp/162
	set a threshold for alerts
		if the num of CRC erros increases by 5, send a trap
		monitoring station can react immediately

*LOGS AND MONITORING*
Traffic logs
	view traffic information from routers, switches, firewalls, etc
	identify traffic flows and summaries
	every flow from every device
	important historical information
		monitoring, post event analysis
Active Directory Infrastructure
Audit logs
	more specific than general traffic logs

 Syslog
	standard for message logging
		diverse systems create a consolidated log
	usually a central logging receiver
		integrated into the SIEM= security information and event manager
	each log entry is labeled
		facility code (program that created the log) and severity level

Security levels
	not all alerts have the same priority
	alerts can be used as a filter

Interface errors
	runts
		frames that are less than 64 bytes
		may result in a collisioon
	giants
		frames that are more than 1518 bytes
	CRC error
		failed the frame check sequence
		may indicate a bad cable or interface
	Encapsulation error
		Inconsistent configurations between switches- ISL or 802.1Q

Enviromental sensors
	temperature
		devices need constant cooling
	Humidity level
		condensation
		low humidity promotes static discharges
	Electrical
		Device and circuit load
	Flooding
		water and electrical devices not good

NetFlow
	gather traffic statistics from all traffic flows
		shared comms between devices
	standard collection method

*HIGH AVAILABILITY 3.3*
Fault tolerance
	maintain uptime in the case of a failure
	fault tolerance adds complexity
	single device fault tolerance
		RAID
		redundant power supplies
		redundant NICs
	Multiple device fault tolerance
		server farms with load balancing multiple network paths

REdundancy and fault tolerance
	redundant hardware components
	RAID= redundant array of independent disks
	UPS= uninterruptible power supplies
	Clustering
		a logical collective of servers
	Load Balancing
		shared service load across components

High availability
	redundancy doesnt always mean always available
	may incude many different components working together
		watch for single points of failure
	Higher availability almost always means higher costs

NIC teaming
load balancing / fail over (LBFO)
	aggregate bandwidth, redundant paths
	becomes more important in the virtual world
multiple network adapters 
	looks like a single adapter
	integrate with switches
NICs talk to each other
	usually multicast instead of broadcast
	fails over when a NIC doesnt respond

*INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT*

	Types
		offilne/standby ups
		line-interactive UPS
		on-line/ double-conversion UPS
	features

	power an entire building
		use battery UPS while the generator starting up
	
HVAC=heating, ventilation, and air conditioning

	PC manages equipment
Fire suppression
	data center fire safety
	common to use inert gases and chemical agents
	integrated into HVAC system
		monitor carbon monoxide

*RECOVERY SITES*
site resiliency
	recovery site is prepped
		data is synced
	a disaster is called
	problem is addressed
	revert back to the primary location
		documentation

Cold site
	no hardware
	no data
	no people
	
Hot site
	an exact replica
	stocked with hardware
	apploications and software are constantly updated
		automated replication
	flip a switch and everything moves

Warm site
	hybrid between cool and hott
	big room with rack space
		bring the hardware
	hardware is ready and waiting
		bring the software and data

Cloud site
	use an established cloud provider
		enough resources for the recovery process
	no separate facility to manage
		online config
	cost can be flat fee or based on use
	the data and applications still need to be moved
		large data storage requirements may create a  challenge

*NETWORK REDUNDANCY*
Active-passive
	two devices are installed and configured
		only works at a time
			constant comms between the two devices
	if one device fails, the other takes over
	configuration and real-time session information is constantly synchronized
		the failover might occur at any time

Active-active
	two devices used at the same time
	More complex to design and operate
		data can flow in many different directions
		challenging to manage the flows
		monitoring and controlling data requires a very good understanding of the underlying infrastructure

Diverse paths
	Create mutiple paths
		more than one internet service provider (ISP)
	may need additional hardware and engineering
		advanced dynamic routing protocols
		failover processes
		local device configurations
	great for redundancy
		no reliance on a single provider

High availability protocols
	FHRP= first hop redundancy protocol]
		device is configured with a single default gateway
			need a way to provide availability if the default gateway fails

	VRRP= virtual router redundancy protocol
		the default router isnt real
		devices use a virtual IP for the default gateway
			if one router disapperas another one takes its place
				data continue to flow


*AVAILABILITY CONCEPTS*
Recovery
RTO=recover time objective
	get up and running quickly 
	get back to a particular service level
RP= recovery point objective
	how much data lost is acceptable
		how far back does data go when the systems are brought back online
MTTR= mean time to repair
	time required to fix the issue
MTBF=mean time between failures
	predict the time between outages

Network device backup and restore
	every device has a configuration
		most devices allow the configuration to be downloaded and uploaded
		configurations may be specific to a version of operation code or firmware
			firmware backups?
	revert to a previous state
		use backup to return to a previous configuration data and time
		might require a firmware or version downgrade
